# Daniel Frederico Lins Leite

# Objective

I have worked for a brief time with CG between 2005-2010 as an amateur Game Developer and after as a contractor for a Dutch company, and I have been planning to return to this area a few years already.

So my objective in applying for this job is to work directly with Computer Graphics and 3D, especially if web-oriented and help to improve the rendering and general application architecture.

Current Salary: PDF version only.

# Needed Skills Assessment

- Extreme proficiency with JavaScript/TypeScript

Practical experience with javascript since 2005, since .NET 2.0; later moved to jQuery; then to Knockout with leafletJS; then six months in an AngularJS project; then 4 years in a ReactJS; now 6 months in a VueJS project.

Today I would start a greenfield project using ParcelJS, ReactJS with DevExpress React framework, for example (opensource I would use office-ui-fabric-react or ant-design), and for more advanced UI I would copy (be motivated!) by CodyHouse examples.

//TODO frontend architecture  

- Excellent 3D math knowledge, and deep experience with computer graphics and 3D programming

To best prove my current knowledge of Computer Graphics I want to point to the series of articles I wrote.

https://github.com/xunilrj/sandbox/tree/master/texts/dev/ComputerScience/Computer%20Graphics

But I also have formal education, and I am BSc on Computer Science with more than 10 math courses and 2 Computer Graphics courses.

//TODO 3D Math tutorials  

- Several years of experience working with low-level graphics, either WebGL, OpenGL, DirectX, etc...

I also have Game Programming experience, first building a space shooter in 2004 (OpenGL) and then working for a small Dutch game company (DirectX) fixing bugs.

I also have a more recent series of articles on webGPU (Vulkan/Metal/D3D12 for the web) here https://github.com/xunilrj/sandbox/blob/master/sources/javascript/webgpu/Readme.md

//TODO more 3D tutorials  

- Highly proficient at developing scalable, highly interactive web applications. (You will be building a web-based tool that lets users customize rooms in 3D with true-to-scale furniture.

In 2012 I was the chief architect of a C2 (Command and Control) web application that is used by the 911 of Rio de Janeiro city. It is a highly dynamic web application where dozens of users are interacting with the same set of objects (phone calls, ambulances and others) that need to work 24/; including a chat application built on top an Actor System (Akka.net).

//TODO backend architecture for dynamic app  

Articles about frontend architecture:

- https://github.com/xunilrj/sandbox/tree/master/sources/javascript/react%2Bfreezer
- TODO: backend with NESTJS
a

- Familiar with SVG and DOM, in general
An understanding of software architecture, clean code, and best practices.

I was the main architect of a suite of two application between 2012-2016. At one point we had 50 programmers.

I am well versed in the following architecture styles:

//TODO list architectures  
//TODO tutorials of sample applications architectures  

- Fluent in English, written and spoken

Although I am Portuguese/Brazilian, I live in the UK since 2016, so hopefully, I can communicate in English! :)

# Summary of Work Experience

## SAI Global 2016-Now

Senior Software Developer - Remote

Improve our Risk Analysis software through Scrum methodology. Standard LOB web application build with .NET Core, React, SQL Server, RabbitMQ and PowerBI.

## Modulo Security Solutions 2009-2016

Started in 2009 as Senior Developer and was promoted to Main Architect in 2012 and Development Manager in 2016. The company was sold to SAI Global in 2016.

The software is relatively big, and we used many technologies throughout the years: .NET 2.0, Webforms, MVC, SQL Server, MSMQ, DevExpress and others.

The most advanced component I developed was a DSL transpiler to C# and JS to allow customized surveys (like Survey Monkey).

## iMusica 2005-2009

I started in 2005 as an intern for an iTunes like application in Brazil.
