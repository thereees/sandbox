# Frontend

For the frontend I use the following tools:

Parcel
https://parceljs.org/

React (or preact)
https://reactjs.org
https://preactjs.com

I developed +4 years using Redux and I dislike all the necessary boilerplate code. Freely I prefer to use freezer and connect it using hooks or as "react-freezer" does.

freezer
https://github.com/arqex/freezer
react-freezer
https://github.com/qur2/react-freezer-js

But if requested I would use:

Redux
https://redux.js.org

connect
https://react-redux.js.org/api/connect

Redux Thunk or Redux Saga
https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk
https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga

For (free) Component framework I like:

grommet
https://v2.grommet.io

For paid one 

DevExtreme
https://js.devexpress.com/

# Back end

For the backend I use:

Express
https://expressjs.com

NestJS
https://nestjs.com

Passport
https://github.com/nestjs/passport

Knex.js
https://knexjs.org/

For the backend architecture I follow what is described [here](../csharp/Readme.md):
